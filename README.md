## Usage & Download

1. Download the [installer](https://github.com/jason-murray/irefined/releases/latest/download/iRefined-win-Setup.exe) and run it.
2. The installer will launch iRefined automatically when it's finished, it runs as a tray app. You will also have a shortcut to iRefined on the desktop and in the start menu.
3. iRefined will load the extension as long as it is running in the system tray (right click to add it to start up!).
4. Once the UI has launched you'll find the iRefined queue & log bar at the bottom of the screen, and the settings button (rocket) in the top right.
5. Many of the features are disabled to start with, open the settings to turn them on.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure iRefined is running before you open the iRacing UI! You can add it to Windows start-up by right clicking the tray icon and choosing this option.

## Common Issues

_Opening the settings sometimes shows the latest announcements screen._  
This can usually be sorted by closing the pop up window and clicking the settings button again.

_Feature x isn't working properly._  
Because the iRacing UI is essentially a website loaded from the internet, iRacing often roll out changes silently. This can lead to some features breaking without notice.
Luckily iRefined takes the same approach and can also load fixes without needing to be explicitly updated by the user. If you find something that's not working right, please [create an issue](https://github.com/jason-murray/irefined/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
